# Java MQTT Explorer
Explorer for MQTT Packages.
Written in Java with Eclipse IDE Version 2020-09 (4.17.0)
Used WindowBuilder to create the UI. Additionally the FlatLeaf Library was used to polish the LookAndFeel.
For the MQTT Connection I used the Eclipse Paho Client.
This App was developed for a school project.
